I had an idea that there could be a certain clumsiness to the character to encourage the player to take their time and think things through... because invariably there'll be levels that you could power through by charging along, I was wondering what you thought about building a handicap into the "run" state by having him stumble or something at random intervals
 
 So if you really wanted to you could run through a level but you'd be periodically vulnerable
 
[me] i was thinking that shooting whilst running would be really inaccurate
: the stumble thing could definitely be done
 or we could have an 'accuracy meter' that shrinks as you run along
...
[alex]Well what really inspires me about the Assassins Creed Multiplayer is that you can't be a cunt, you play by the rules and you play well or you die
(12:18:21) sean.talbot@gmail.com/8BEC519E: yeah
(12:18:24) Alexander Bertram-Powell: There are very few shortcuts or cheats
(12:18:37) sean.talbot@gmail.com/8BEC519E: that's good - that may mean less AI coding!
(12:18:51) Alexander Bertram-Powell: And even if you run around making quick kills, the stealthy guy who does quality playing still wins
(12:19:04) sean.talbot@gmail.com/8BEC519E: yeah, we can have different scores for different kills

Long range bonus ("marksman"), Stealth based on enemy's awareness of player character etc.
(12:22:03) sean.talbot@gmail.com/8BEC519E: makes level design all the more important so that it's actually possible to kill enemies in various ways
(12:22:10) sean.talbot@gmail.com/8BEC519E: yes
 ages ago I was thinking of having a 'wind' bar, which you'd have to offset your shots to, like in golf, but now I'm thinking that might be a bit silly if we have all these other handicaps

(12:25:14) Alexander Bertram-Powell: Borrowing more from AC2 (without being blatant) I don't know if you noticed but the system there is less to do with specific actions than the bodypart you're controlling
(12:25:27) Alexander Bertram-Powell: So there's a button for head, legs, left hand and right hand
Head button is mainly used for talking, left hand is weapon, right hand is pushing or operating machinery, legs is running or jumping
(12:26:21) sean.talbot@gmail.com/8BEC519E: cool
(12:26:58) Alexander Bertram-Powell: So maybe we can figure a simplified version of that concept where one or two buttons have different functions depending on what the player is doing - mid air, walking, running etc.
